# Twitter-Like Feed Solution 4: React JS App & Node JS Server

A full-stack web application in React JS & Node JS to simulate a twitter-like feed.

## Assessment Guide Feedback

- Does the code work? **Yes**
- Does the code read well? **Yes**
- Does the code handle errors? **Yes**
- Is the code unit tested? **Yes, except the React Components & Express Routes - ambition got the best of me**

## How To Run It

There is some more work involved in running this one, buckle up.

In the **/server** folder:

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies

Run `npm test` to make sure it will run later

Run `npm start` to get the server going

Now, in a new terminal (told you there was more work) in the root directory:

Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies (yes, again...)

skip tests this time - ran out of time before I could write those :(

Run `npm start` and enjoy
